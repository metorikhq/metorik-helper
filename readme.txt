The Metorik Helper helps provide your WooCommerce store with powerful analytics, reports, and tools.

== Description ==

> **Note:** This plugin is only really of use to you if you have a Metorik account/store. You can set one up for free and enjoy a 30 day trial, but keep in mind that it is a paid service. [**Try Metorik for free!**](https://metorik.com?ref=wporg)

In just a few clicks, Metorik gives your store a powerful real-time dashboard, unifying your store's orders, customers, and products, helping you understand your data and make more informed decisions every day.

= Blazing fast =

Tired of spending half your day waiting for WooCommerce reports to load? Metorik spins up detailed reports and charts faster than any other tool available. It also reduces the load on your site's admin dashboard since you can do everything from Metorik, as such making your site faster.

= Powerful and custom reporting =

Metorik includes [a ton of reports](https://metorik.com/features/reports?ref=wporg), covering everything from revenue to sales by state, customer stats and cart abandonment metrics. Every report can be exported, all charts can be downloaded as beautiful custom images, and you can forecast any report in a single click.

Better yet, every single report can be filtered, letting you build custom reports with zero code using our intuitive segmenting system.

= Every KPI you could ask for =

What's your average customer LTV (lifetime value)? What's your average numbers of items per order? How many of product A or variation B did you sell last month? If these are questions you've always wanted answers for, Metorik will be a lifesaver.

= Custom Dashboards =

With Metorik, you can build custom dashboards and reports. Include the metrics and KPIs you track, custom segments (more on that below), and share dashboards you create with your team.

Using our drag and drop builder, it's easy to build the reporting dashboard your business needs - no coding required.

= Segment everything by anything =

Metorik offers a robust & powerful [segmenting system](https://metorik.com/features/segmenting?ref=wporg). It allows you segment your data by anything and everything (seriously), export that segmented data to a CSV (automatically, if that's your thing). You can even save the filters you used for next time, or share them with your team.

Want all customers who have an LTV over $100 and own a certain product? **Easy.**

Orders that were made last month where 2 items were purchased and the customer was from the UK? **Easy.**

Subscriptions that were set to be canceled this week? **Easy.**

Customers who haven't ordered in 4 months and live in California? **Easy.**

= Send automated emails to customers =

With [Metorik Engage](https://metorik.com/features/engage?ref=wporg) and it's accompanying segmenting system, you can send targeted emails to customers automatically as soon as they match certain rules.

For example, email customers whenever they've spent over $500 and include a coupon code uniquely generated for them for 20% off.

Writing emails couldn't be easier with Engage's email builder and each automation comes with a comprehensive report so you can see which emails are converting and which ones are being ignored.

= Costs & profit reports =

Metorik includes a full featured [cost & profit reporting system](https://metorik.com/features/costs?ref=wporg), which lets you calculate product, shipping, transaction, advertising, and extra costs for each order.

If you're already using WooCommerce's cost of goods plugin, we'll automatically import product costs, or otherwise you can set and import costs into Metorik.

When it comes to shipping costs, you can calculate costs by weight, shipping charged, and more. For transaction costs, set % and $ costs, or automatically use the actual cost charged by Stripe, PayPal, etc.

And on the advertising costs side, Metorik automatically syncs ad costs from Google Ads, Facebook Ads, TikTok, and Pinterest.

= Cart tracking and reports =

[Metorik tracks every cart](https://metorik.com/features/carts?ref=wporg) started on your store, making it easy for you to see all open, abandoned, and placed carts. Also included is the Carts Report, covering all of your cart-related stats.

And better yet, through Metorik Engage, you can send automatic abandoned cart emails to try get customers to complete their purchase.

= Customer service integrations =

Metorik integrates with your existing support system to show customer data right alongside support tickets. Data like their contact information, lifetime value, order history, products purchased and more, instantly at you and your customer service teams' fingertips. Additionally, you'll find data from your support systems shown on order pages and customer profiles in Metorik.

Integrations are currently available for [Zendesk](https://metorik.com/blog/connecting-zendesk-and-woocommerce?ref=wporg), Help Scout, Freshdesk, and Intercom, with more to come.

= Google Analytics integration =

Connect your Google Analytics account to Metorik and get access to stats like conversion rates instantly. Better yet, you can get **historical conversion rates!** [Read more about it here](https://metorik.com/blog/conversation-rates-for-woocommerce-with-google-analytics?ref=wporg).

= Email + Slack reports =

Automatically receive reports summarising your store's activity as often as you'd like. They can be sent by both Email & Slack, and include your KPIs, charts, best sellers, and more.

= One-off and automated exports =

Any data can be exported from Metorik at any time in minutes. You can even schedule exports to happen automatically as often as you'd like.

*Bonus:* These exports have zero-impact on your site whatsoever. No more server downtime!

= WooCommerce Subscriptions support =

Metorik integrates seamlessly with [WooCommerce Subscriptions](https://metorik.com/features/subscriptions?ref=wporg), offering subscription filtering & exporting, along with reports like MRR, Churn, Retention, Forecasting, and more. You can even have an automated subscriptions report sent to you every day summarising everything subscriptions-related.

= Fast support =

Support is available to every Metorik user, whether you're just starting your trial or have used us for years. We'll personally work with you to ensure you and your team get the most out of Metorik. There's a reason why 5000+ stores and 1000s of customers trust us as their WooCommerce reporting solution - [view the love](https://metorik.com/love).

= Bring your team =

Whether you're running a store solo or bringing your team, Metorik has your back through its team system. Each store can have **unlimited team members** at no extra cost, each with their own role & permissions. No more sharing sales reports with your support reps and no more analytics modifying orders by accident.

= More? =

Oh, there's so much more. Seriously. Just have a look around the [Metorik website](https://metorik.com?ref=wporg) to get an idea of how valuable Metorik will be for your store.

The Metorik Helper helps [Metorik](https://metorik.com?ref=wporg) connect and work better with your site. Simply install, activate and Metorik will take care of the rest!

== Installation ==
Install, activate and leave it to do the rest.

Keep in mind that you do need a Metorik account for it to work with, so if you don't yet have a store set up in Metorik, head to [Metorik](https://metorik.com?ref=wporg) and sign up now.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
**Do I need a Metorik account to use this plugin?**

Yes, you do ([sign up here](https://metorik.com?ref=wporg)). It will still work but will really not be of much use to you without one.

**Can I hide the Metorik links in my WordPress dashboard?**

If you truly want to (but why! They're so handy), you can. Simply add:

`
add_filter( 'metorik_show_ui', '__return_false' );
`

To your theme's `functions.php` or a custom plugin.

The other option is to simply 'dimiss' a Metorik notice and they will no longer appear.

To hide the links from individual orders/products, you can click the 'Screen Options' tab at the top of the page and uncheck the Metorik option.

**I accidentally hid the notices. How can I get them back?**

To get them back, go to http://yoursite.com/wp-admin?show-metorik-notices=yes while logged in as an administrator.
